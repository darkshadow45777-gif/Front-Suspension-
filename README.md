# Front-Suspension-
A functional front suspension with steering, the wheels are unpowered I have provided the Cad files (specfically from FreeCad, which is an open source Cad software), plus images of prototypes that I have made

I have also provided pictures of 3 assemblies that I made in FreeCad, note they are all interconnected with on another, and I couldn't fit them all onto one assembly due to the limitations of the software I'm using.

Note I have attached some Cad Files as aditional evidence in a sperate branch of this repository.
