# Front-Suspension-
A functional front suspension with steering, the wheels are unpowered I have provided the Cad files (specfically from FreeCad, which is an open source Cad software), plus images of prototypes that I have made

I have also provided pictures of 3 assemblies that I made in FreeCad, note they are all interconnected with on another, and I couldn't fit them all onto one assembly due to the limitations of the software I'm using.

Note I have attached some Cad Files as aditional evidence in a sperate branch of this repository (if you are not fimilar with Github click on 'main' on the the left hand side, their should be a drop down menu that pops up, then if you click "darkshadow45777 -Cadfiles" you should be able to see the Cad files, note that can only be opened by the freecad software).
